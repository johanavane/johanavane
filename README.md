# Hi there!

ðŸŽ“ I'm Johana Martinez, a **Front End Developer** with a Bachelors in **Computer Science** from UC Santa Cruz.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **Front End** or **Full Stack** projects.

ðŸŒ± Outside of coding, I love being out in nature. Whether that is going to the beach, hiking or traveling. I also spend my time thrifting, reading and doing pilates.
